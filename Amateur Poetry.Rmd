## **As time passes ... **

As time passes…   


I feel so low  
Searching for clues,  
Covering up the holes  

I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul  
I'll throw all of my cares away for you  
I'll be there to wait for you  

Maybe you weren't the one for me  
But deep down I wanted you to be  

I'll still see you in my dreams  
All the things that I did for you,   
Just I wasn't it for you  

Moving on seems harder to do  
When the one that you love moves faster than you  

I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies  
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me  

As time passes I'm feeling kinda light  
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight  

I may not be over you, but I'll try inside  
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now  


I noticed you weren't the one for me  
You weren't the one for me.
