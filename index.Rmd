I'm Lizbeth, a PhD student in Environmental and Occupational Health at Drexel Dornsife School of Public Health. I am originally from the Dominican Republic. Over the years I’ve developed a loving relationship with public health research and environmental justice. I like to spend my free time hiking, gardening and exploring the great outdoors.
