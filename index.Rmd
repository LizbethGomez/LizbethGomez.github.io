## **Hello, welcome to my website** 

I'm Lizbeth, a PhD student in Environmental and Occupational Health at Dornsife School of Public Health. I am originally from the Dominican Republic. Over the years I’ve developed a loving relationship with public health research and environmental justice.  

My academic and professional journey has been very straightforward. I received my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences and Chemistry from The City College of New York and a masters in Public Health from Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health.


## **My interests include:**

- Social and environmental deteminants of health 
- Cities, Architecture, and Space
- Environmental Health and Sustainability Efforts
- Classical Conceptions of Virtue
- Pediatric asthma exacerbation etiology
